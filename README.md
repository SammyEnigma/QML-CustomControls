# QML-CustomControls by Lorenzo Aldrighetti
A project that contains a gallery of controls created thinking about the customization, efficiency and simplicity

## Instructions
The project is a simple gallery of all the controls that I have developed.
For use one of that copy and paste simply the .qml file of the interested control, contained inside the *Components* folder

## Suggestions
Some controls are so pretty thanks to the shadows, but shadows take time to render. If you want more lightweight controls for an embedded interface for example, remove the component called *DropShadow* and also the inclusion of *QtGraphicalEffects 1.0*

## Tests
The code was tested using Qt 5.13 and MVSC 2017 64bit on Windows
